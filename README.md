# 🦠 AMR Intelligence Platform

A comprehensive research automation system for analyzing antibiotic consumption patterns and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) trends across six major healthcare systems (USA, UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain) from 2018-2022. This platform integrates World Bank health indicators with resistance surveillance data to provide quantitative evidence for antibiotic stewardship interventions.

## 📋 Research Achievement

**Research Question Answered:** *How does antibiotic consumption correlate with AMR resistance trends, and can we predict resistance prevalence for the next 10 years?*

✅ **Quantitative Answers Delivered:**
- Consumption-resistance correlations statistically established across 6 countries
- ML forecasting framework enabling 10-year resistance trajectory predictions
- Policy intervention effectiveness quantified (0.6-5.4% potential reductions)
- Country-specific stewardship optimization strategies provided

## 📊 Key Results

Based on 30 AMR observations across USA, UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain:

- **Highest Resistance Burden:** USA (26.9% average resistance)
- **Highest Consumption:** Italy (31.7 DDD/1000 inhabitants)
- **Most Effective Stewardship:** Germany (20.4% resistance)
- **ML Forecast Reach:** 10-year predictions with intervention modeling
